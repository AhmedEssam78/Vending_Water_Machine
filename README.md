# Vending_Water_Machine
The project is building a water vending machine which is responsible for taking 
a specific amount of money to pour water for the customer. For more details, 
the user can increase the amount of money by three types of incrementations: 
one, five, or ten pounds. When the money reaches 20 pounds (The water 
price), the water is pouring. Consequently, there are three conditions that can 
stop the water:
1- The user presses the push button while pouring
2- Thirty seconds have passed without any interaction
3- The user adds more amount of money
